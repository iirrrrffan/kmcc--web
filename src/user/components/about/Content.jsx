          The Kerala Muslim Cultural Centre (KMCC) is an expatriate charity and
          volunteer organisation for expatriates from Kerala. Formed in 1981 as
          an official organisation of the All India Muslim League (AIML) under
          Umar Bafakhy Thangal, KMCC has promoted the welfare of expatriate
          Indians through relief activities, C.H. centers and social services.
          Excellent organisational abilities and diverse activities embracing
          all aspects of social life have now enabled us to proceed down
          hitherto unseen roads. A rich history spanning four decades is an
          journey brimming with experiences that defy explanation. KMCC has been
          receiving thunderous applause for its sincere efforts for the social,
          cultural, economical and educative upliftment of malayalees all over
          the world. Riyadh KMCC has been a strong and persistent activist in
          promoting the welfare of expatriate Indians and addressing their
          day-to-day issues. KMCC has a major footprint in Middle Eastern
          nations. . Crores in relief efforts, activities through C.H. centres,
          social service activities such as house construction for the
          destitute, medical aid, educational help, disaster relief, and so on
          have made us the successors of a service model legacy. It would not be
          shocking to suggest that there isn't a single rural community in
          Kerala where the KMCC hasn't reached out. KMCC Riyadh is a signature
          of good deeds that has contributed immensely to the all-round growth
          of the social, cultural, religious, educational and philanthropic
          fields of the native land. We have motivated people via social
          security initiatives and service activities, leaving a mark of
          humanitarian compassion that even governments cannot match. During the
          pandemic, when death was playing right in front of everyone's eyes,
          the KMCC team won worldwide acclaim for their unrivalled service
          mission. Our founders started this organisation through their tireless
          efforts at a period when such advancements or developments in
          technology and jobs were unavailable. They have practically spilt
          their blood to keep this organisation alive. We've succeeded after
          overcoming several obstacles and tough conditions. KMCC has been
          conducting various community programs especially, â€œ Inter-faith
          relationship, Communal harmony, Cultural programs, Iftar parties,
          Patriotic programs, Educational seminars, Islamic teachings, National
          day and Republic day celebrations, Religious tour arrangements etc..
          are carried out on weekly and monthly basis throughout the Middle
          East.
